# APT-X for Oreo Module

Android Oreo officially supports APT-X bluetooth audio, however not all phones have the needed library files. This module simply places the missing APT-X(HD) and LDAC files in your system if you don't already have it. Enjoy better bluetooth audio! You can check if it works by going to your bluetooth settings (your headphones must support it of course) and otherwise in the developer options.

-v1 initial release
-v2 updated template to 15.3
